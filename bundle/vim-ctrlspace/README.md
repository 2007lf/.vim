Welcome to **Vim-CtrlSpace**, a comprehensive solution for your Vim editor
providing:

* tabs / buffers / files management
* fast fuzzy searching **powered by Go**
* workspaces (sessions)
* bookmarks for your favorite projects

The plugin name follows the convention of naming fuzzy search plugins
after their default mappings (like _Command-T_ or _CtrlP_), hence the
plugin mapping is by default `Ctrl` + `Space`.

If you like the plugin please don't forget to leave a :star: for this
project! This will help me to estimate the plugin popularity and plan
further development :).

If you have already starred this repo, thank you! Thanks to you it's my
pet project now :). If you have a question, a feature request, or a new
idea, don't hesitate to post new issues or pull requests. Collaboration is
the most awesome thing in the open source community!


### Version 5

Vim-CtrlSpace started over 2 years ago as a fork of [another
plugin](https://github.com/roblillack/vim-bufferlist) and the Version
**5** is the result of the experience gained during that period and
cooperation with the community.

Version 5 is the biggest upgrade in the plugin history. All plugin code
has been rewritten from scratch taking user feedback as a great resource
of ideas and challenges into account. Thanks to users the plugin has
configurable key mappings and allows you to handle projects with **100
000** files!

In case you're curious, Vim-CtrlSpace 5 took me 5 months of spare evenings
to complete :).

The most exciting **Vim-CtrlSpace 5** features are:

* better, modular, and extensible code base
* simplified, well thought-out, and clear design
* new fuzzy search engine for files (written in Go)
* more effective and responsive behavior
* fine-grained configuration

Version 5 is not backward compatible. All configuration variables and API
functions have been renamed. Please check Vim help for more info:

```VimL
:help ctrlspace-configuration
```


## Idea by Analogy

Vim-CtrlSpace interface is a window you can invoke by pressing
`<C-Space>`. The window displays a list of items. You can select those
items with `<h>`, `<j>`, and `<CR>` keys.

<p align="center">
<img alt="Vim-CtrlSpace" src="https://raw.github.com/vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace/master/gfx/cs5_window.png" />
</p>

Generally speaking Vim-CtrlSpace can display 5 types of lists:

* Buffer List
* File List
* Tab List
* Workspace List
* Bookmark List

Lists can be explained with a simple analogy. Let's imagine Vim is
a writing desk. Your projects are like drawers. The **Bookmark List**
simply displays your favorite projects.

To get documents from a drawer you would need a **File List**. It allows
you to easily look up contents of a given project. Once you locate and
pick up a file it becomes a **buffer**.

A buffer is like a sheet of paper lying on the desk. Sometimes you can
have a blank piece of paper – that's a new unsaved buffer. It would become
eventually a file on the disk once saved (put into a drawer). To manage
all buffers on the desk you would need a **Buffer List**.

So far our analogy is fairly simple. This workflow is straightforward but
inefficient in the long run with a large amount of files. How could we
optimize it?

The answer are **tabs** – a secret weapon of **Vim-CtrlSpace**. Each tab
holds a **separate** list of buffers. And this is something very different
when compared to plain Vim. Tabs powered by the plugin can be seen as
piles of documents on the desk.

With tabs you can, for example:

* group related buffers
* extract to other tabs
* name them accordingly
* move or copy them

Tabs usage in **Vim-CtrlSpace** is quite more extensive than in Vim. This
is because they serve mainly as independent buffer lists, so you are
likely to have plenty of them. Tabs can be accessed and managed within
**Tab List**.

All your buffers, tabs, and tab layouts can be persisted as a workspace.
It's like taking a picture of your desk with an instant camera. You can
save multiple workspaces per project with **Workspace List**.


## Getting Started

### Installation

If you use Vundle add to your `.vimrc`:

```VimL
Plugin 'vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace'
```

You can also clone the repository to your `.vim` directory:

```Shell
cd ~/.vim
git clone https://github.com/vim-ctrlspace/vim-ctrlspace.git .
```

### Basic Settings

First please make sure that you set `nocompatible` and `hidden` options
(required by the plugin) in your `.vimrc`:

```VimL
set nocompatible
set hidden
```

If you feel brave enough **turn off** tabline:

```VimL
set showtabline=0
```

Tabline in Vim has very limited capabilities and as Vim-CtrlSpace makes
use of tabs intensively, tabline would just get in your way. **Tab List**
(`<l>`) makes tabline obsolete ;).


#### Go Engine

The plugin provides engine compiled for popular operating systems and
architectures. By default it will attempt to detect your os and
architecture. To see if auto detection was successful press `<?>`.

To find more about file engines check:

```VimL
:help g:CtrlSpaceFileEngine
```


#### Symbols

Vim-Ctrlspace displays icons in the UI if your font supports UTF8, or
ASCII characters as a fallback. Some symbols (glyphs) might not look well
with the font you are using, so feel free to change and adjust them.

This is the config I use for Inconsolata font in MacVim:

```VimL
if has("gui_running")
    " Settings for MacVim and Inconsolata font
    let g:CtrlSpaceSymbols = { "File": "◯", "CTab": "▣", "Tabs": "▢" }
endif
```

Since it's impossible to provide universal character set that would look well
on any machine, therefore the fine tuning is left up to you.

You can find more about this tuning option in the plugin help:

```VimL
:help g:CtrlSpaceSymbols
```

If you feel that you have found a better symbol for a given view, you are
more than welcome to open a pull request.


#### Glob Command

Another important setting is the *Glob* command. This command is used to
collect all files in your project directory. Specifically, I recommend
that you install and use `ag`, as it respects `.gitignore` rules and is
really fast. Once it's installed you can add this line to your `.vimrc`:

```VimL
if executable("ag")
    let g:CtrlSpaceGlobCommand = 'ag -l --nocolor -g ""'
endif
```

#### Search Timing

If you usually have to deal with huge projects having 100 000 files you
can increase plugin fuzzy search delay to make it even more responsible by
providing a higher `g:CtrlSpaceSearchTiming` value:

```VimL
let g:CtrlSpaceSearchTiming = 500
```

#### Colors

Finally, you can adjust some plugin colors. By default plugin uses
the following setup:

```VimL
hi link CtrlSpaceNormal   PMenu
hi link CtrlSpaceSelected PMenuSel
hi link CtrlSpaceSearch   Search
hi link CtrlSpaceStatus   StatusLine
```

However some color schemes show search results with the same colors as
PMenu groups. If that's your case try to link CtrlSpaceSearch highlight
group to IncSearch instead:

```VimL
hi link CtrlSpaceSearch IncSearch
```

Of course nothing prevents you from providing your own highlighting, for example:

```VimL
hi CtrlSpaceSearch guifg=#cb4b16 guibg=NONE gui=bold ctermfg=9 ctermbg=NONE term=bold cterm=bold
```


### First Steps

Alright! You've hopefully installed, configured Vim-CtrlSpace, and
restarted Vim (otherwise do it!). Now you're wondering how to start using
this thing.

First, you need to select a project. Vim operates in a directory,
described as `CWD` (_Current Working Directory_). If you've just started
a MacVim it's probably pointing to your home directory (issue `:pwd` to
check it).

I advise you to add a project to the Bookmark List by opening the plugin
window (`<C-Space>`) and pressing `<b>`. The plugin will ask for a project
directory.

Make sure that the path **is not your home directory**. Otherwise the
plugin will start indexing all your files which will be pointless and
resource exhaustive. Be concrete and provide a real path to a project.
Once your bookmark is created, you can go there with `<CR>`.

Now open some files with `<o>`. Finally save a workspace with `<w>` by
providing your first workspace name.

For more information please check out Vim-CtrlSpace help directly in Vim:

```VimL
:help ctrlspace
```

For key reference press `<?>` inside the plugin window.

### Fuzzy Search Hints

If you are used to hitting the `<ctrl-P>` key combination for fuzzy search, add
this to your .vimrc file:

```VimL
nnoremap <silent><C-p> :CtrlSpace O<CR>
```

Be sure to remember to refresh your search file list using `<r>` command.

### Automatically Saving Workspace

Ctrl-Space can automatically save your workspace status based on configurations below:

```VimL
let g:CtrlSpaceLoadLastWorkspaceOnStart = 1
let g:CtrlSpaceSaveWorkspaceOnSwitch = 1
let g:CtrlSpaceSaveWorkspaceOnExit = 1
```
